    As a kid I've fallen in love with computers.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Since then I've had the privilege of immerse in the world of <b>web security</b>, developing <b>CTF</b> challenges for a <b>start-up</b>, doing <b>bug bounty</b>, conduct <b>EU & US hacking competitions</b>, speaking at <b>meetups and conferences</b>.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Nowadays I'm <b>building</b> <i>(instead of hacking)</i> products and leading projects for our clients at <b>Illuminance Labs</b> using <b>AWS</b>. In my free time I'm usually <b>learning</b> and <b>coding for fun</b>.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    When I'm not at the computer, I'm playing <b>board games</b>, spending time with my <b>wife</b>, or doing <b>sports</b>.
